### Hello

Below I you can find various coding projects carried out during my education in physics. Most notebooks are self explanatory.

hubbardclass.py is a short python script that can be used to generate the Hamiltonian matrix for the Hubbard model, one only needs to specify the size of the system, dimension it is in etc. This was used extensively to generate data for a machine learning project on learning the universal functional defined in density functional theory.
